This repository contains the official documentation for **Rabbit Form Validation Library**, a simple and efficient form validation library that makes validating `text` and `checkbox` inputs easy, with built-in support for Bootstrap and plans to expand and be CSS framework agnostic.

## Features

- **Validations based on `data-rabbit-***` attributes: Validate inputs using custom attributes without the need to manually write functions.
- **Support for `text` and `checkbox` inputs**: Handle validations such as minimum and maximum length, regular expressions, and more.
- **Bootstrap integration**: Display feedback messages using Bootstrap's native components.
- **Easy to extend**: Work is underway to make the library compatible with any CSS framework and customizable with callbacks.
