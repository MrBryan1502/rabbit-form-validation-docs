## Rabbit Form Validation Library Initialization

To start using **Rabbit Form Validation Library**, you must initialize it correctly depending on whether you are using **JavaScript modules** or not.

### Using JavaScript modules

1. Make sure you import the `RabbitFormValidation()` function into the JavaScript file that acts as the entry point for your site.
   
   ```javascript
   import { RabbitFormValidation } from './path/to/rabbit-form-validation.js';
   ```

2. It is advisable to run the function inside the `DOMContentLoaded` event to ensure that the entire DOM is fully loaded before validating the forms.

   ```javascript
   document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
      RabbitFormValidation();
   });
   ```

### Without using JavaScript modules

1. Load the library file in the HTML of the page where you want to implement validation. When you download the library, the file is called `rabbit-form-validation.js`.

   ```html
   <script src="path/to/rabbit-form-validation.js"></script>
   ```

2. Then, run the RabbitFormValidation() function after the DOM has loaded, also inside the `DOMContentLoaded` event:

   ```html
   <script>
      document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {
         RabbitFormValidation();
      });
   </script>
   ```

### What's next?

Now that the library is properly initialized, you can begin defining your form validations using the `data-rabbit-` attributes on the form fields. In the next step, you will learn how to configure validation rules.
