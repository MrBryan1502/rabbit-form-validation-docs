## Validation with `data-rabbit` Attributes

The **Rabbit Form Validation Library** uses custom `data-rabbit` attributes to identify and manage form validation in a declarative manner. These attributes allow the library to know which form elements need to be validated and what rules apply to each.

### General Requirements

1. **`data-rabbit-validable` attribute on the form:**
- Every form that contains inputs that you want to validate must have the `data-rabbit-validable` attribute. This tells the library to validate the fields within that form.

```html
<form data-rabbit-validable>
<!-- Inputs here -->
</form>
```

2. **`data-rabbit-validable` attribute on each input:**
- Each input that needs validation must also have the `data-rabbit-validable` attribute, regardless of its type (text, checkbox, etc.). This ensures that that field will be validated against the rules defined through other `data-rabbit` attributes.

```html
<input type="text" data-rabbit-validable />
```

### Form example

Here is a simple example of how the data-rabbit-validable attribute is applied to a form and the fields you want to validate:

```html
<form data-rabbit-validable>
<div>
<label for="name">Name:</label>
<input id="name" type="text" data-rabbit-validable data-rabbit-min="3" data-rabbit-max="20" />
<div class="valid-feedback">All good!</div>
<div class="invalid-feedback">Something seems wrong!</div>
</div>

<div>
<label for="terms">Accept Terms:</label>
<input id="terms" type="checkbox" data-rabbit-validable data-rabbit-require />
<div class="valid-feedback">All right!</div>
<div class="invalid-feedback">This field is required!</div>
</div>

<button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form>
```

### Displaying validations

Currently, the library uses Bootstrap components to display validations:

- ```<div class="valid-feedback" >```: To display positive feedback when a field is valid.
- ```<div class="invalid-feedback" >```: To display negative feedback when a field is invalid.

> **Note**: We are working on making the library CSS framework agnostic. In future releases, you will be able to customize the display of validations via the `RabbitFormValidation()` function using specific element selectors for validations or via callbacks that are executed when there are valid or invalid fields.

### What's next?

In the next section, we will explore how to set up validations for text inputs using the `data-rabbit` attributes.
